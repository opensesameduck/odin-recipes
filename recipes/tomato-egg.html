            <li>1 scallion (green onion)</li>
            <li>4 eggs</li>
            <li>3/4 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon white pepper</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon sesame oil</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon shaoxing wine</li>
            <li>3 tbsp vegetable oil</li>
            <li>2 teaspoon sugar</li>
            <li>1/4-1/2 cup water</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Start by cutting tomatoes into small wedges and finely chop the scallion.</li>
            <li>Crack 4 eggs into a bowl and season with 1/4 teaspoon salt, 1/4 teaspoon white pepper, 1/2 teaspoon sesame oil, and 1 teaspoon
            Shaoxing wine. Beat eggs for a minute.</li>
            <li>Preheat the wok over medium heat until it just starts to smoke. Then add 2 tablespoons of oil and immediately add the
            eggs. Scramble the eggs and remove from the wok immediately. Set aside.</li>
            <li>Add 1 more tablespoon oil to the wok, turn up the heat to high, and add the tomatoes and scallions. Stir-fry for 1
            minute, and then add 2 teaspoons sugar, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and 1/4 cup water (if your stove gets very hot and liquid tends
            to cook off very quickly in your wok, add a little more water). Add the cooked eggs.</li>
            <li>Mix everything together, cover the wok, and cook for 1-2 minutes, until the tomatoes are completely softened.</li>
            <li>Uncover, and continue to stir-fry over high heat until the sauce thickens to your liking. Serve!</li>
        </ol>
