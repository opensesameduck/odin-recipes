        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>This is a <strong>delicious</strong> and <strong>fluffy</strong> banana bread recipe using very easy ingredients. The brown butter and chocolate chip addition makes this a sweet treat and you'll never go back to your regular banana bread recipe again!</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1/2 cup unsalted butter</li>
            <li>1 cup brown sugar</li>
            <li>3 mashed overripe bananas</li>
            <li>1 egg</li>
            <li>2-4 tbsp of milk (add only if the batter is too thick)</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
            <li>2 cups flour</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1 cup semi-sweet chocolate chips</li>
        </ul>

        <ol>
            <li><strong>Preheat the Oven:</strong>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C) and adjust the rack to the center position. Preheating ensures that the oven is at
            the right temperature for baking, which helps the bread rise properly and cook evenly.</li>
            <li><strong>Brown the Butter:</strong>In a medium saucepan, melt the unsalted butter over medium-low heat. As the butter melts, it will begin to foam. Swirl
            the pan occasionally to ensure even heating. The butter will then start to turn a golden brown color and develop a nutty
            aroma. This process usually takes about 5-8 minutes. Be careful not to burn the butter; once it reaches a rich brown
            color, remove it from the heat and transfer it to a heatproof bowl to cool.</li>
            <li><strong>Prepare the Pan:</strong>Grease a 9 by 5-inch loaf pan or line it with parchment paper. This step ensures that the banana bread doesn’t stick to the
            pan and makes it easier to remove after baking.</li>
            <li><strong>Mash the Bananas:</strong>In a large bowl, mash the overripe bananas with a fork until smooth. The riper the bananas, the sweeter and more
            flavorful your bread will be. Overripe bananas are also easier to mash and incorporate into the batter.</li>
            <li><strong>Combine Wet Ingredients:</strong>To the mashed bananas, add the cooled brown butter, brown sugar, egg, and vanilla extract. Whisk everything together
            until well combined. The brown butter adds a rich, nutty flavor to the bread, while the brown sugar adds sweetness and
            moisture.</li>
            <li><strong>Mix Dry Ingredients:</strong>In a separate bowl, whisk together the all-purpose flour, baking soda, and salt. Mixing the dry ingredients separately
            helps to ensure that they are evenly distributed throughout the batter, resulting in a uniform texture.</li>
            <li><strong>Fold Wet And Dry Ingredients:</strong>Pour the dry ingredients into the bowl with the wet ingredients. Using a rubber spatula, gently fold the ingredients
            together until just combined. Be careful not to overmix, as this can lead to a dense and tough banana bread.<strong>TIP - If your batter is too thick, add in 2-4 tbsp of milk to thin it out.</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Add Chocolate Chips:</strong>Gently fold in the chocolate chips until evenly distributed throughout the batter. The chocolate chips add pockets of
            melted chocolate and extra sweetness to the bread.</li>
            <li><strong>Transfer Batter to Pan:</strong>Pour the batter into the prepared 9 by 5 pan. Spread it out evenly with a spatula. Top with additional chocolate chips.</li>
            <li><strong>Bake:</strong>Place the pan in the preheated oven and bake for 55-65 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out
            clean. If the bread starts to brown too much on top, you can tent it with aluminum foil halfway through baking.</li>
            <li><strong>Cool and Serve:</strong>Remove the brown butter chocolate chip banana bread from the oven and let it cool in the pan for about 10 minutes. Then,
            transfer it to a wire rack to cool completely before slicing. This allows the bread to set and makes it easier to slice
            without crumbling.</li>
            <li><strong>Enjoy!</strong>Once the brown butter chocolate chip banana bread has cooled, slice it into thick slices and serve. This rich & decadent
            banana bread makes it a delicious treat for any time of day. Serve it plain or with a dollop of whipped cream or a scoop
            of ice cream for an extra indulgent treat</li>
        </ol>
